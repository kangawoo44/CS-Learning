/*
Write a function called "same", which accepts two arrays.
The function should return true if every value in the array has it's 
corresponding values squared in the second array.

same([1,2,3], [4,1,9]) //true
same([1,2,3], [1,9]) //false
same([1,2,1], [4,4,1]) //false â€” must be same frequency, one 4 and two 1's
