How can we determine which implementation of the same function is best?

When working with a huge data set, algorithm differences could save an hour every time it runs, for example.

Performance matters at that point and it's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs.

It's important to understand how a solution performs and how it compares to others. It's also good to understand the trade offs between approaches, because often it's not as cut and dry.

Comparison is made with the number of ![operations](./images/bigO-counting-operations.png "Counting Operations).
